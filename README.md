# Everdragons2 DAO Eggs lottery
A repo to extract the winners and validate the results

## Install

If you do not have node installed, please install it. Then install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

## The process

The list of all the members with level >= 2 is in [`/data/member-at-levels-greater-than-one.csv`](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/28-dragons-lottery/blob/main/data/member-at-levels-greater-than-one.csv)

Running
```
npm run get-list
```
you get the array of all the eligibles in [`/data/eligible-members-by-level.json`](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/28-dragons-lottery/blob/main/data/eligible-members-by-level.json). Since any name appears as many times as its level, a pseudo image with a hash is added to the element to make any element different. So, for example, you have something like
``` 
 ...
  {
    "name": "Anh",
    "image": "0x0d3a8cd4d221bdba00a94f18e1b2256070450ebb2b15658dc545a96cddcd54bb"
  },
  {
    "name": "Anh",
    "image": "0xe8aa5b905607584eb4fecfff67988af8595d7f79927e99ccce2d8dab8de7b794"
  },
 ...
```

During the AMA, at 10:38 am PST, we took the latest block on Ethereum main net, block number [14102316](https://etherscan.io/block/14102316).

Its hash â€” `0x5430007dba9e19661c54243ea49b8cdd05eefa9b0d781ea73c98f2ca694e378b` â€” has been stored in [`/data/snapshot.json`](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/28-dragons-lottery/blob/main/data/snapshot.json) to be used as salt to shuffle the array of the eligibles.

Running
```
npm run get-winners
```
we produce the file [`/output/winners.txt`](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/28-dragons-lottery/blob/main/output/winners.txt) with 28 winners and the file [`/output/front-runners.txt`](https://github.com/ndujaLabs/28-dragons-lottery/blob/main/output/front-runners.txt) with the remaining users. Since any winner who is no more a member of the Everdragons2 server is removed from the list, more members are taken from the front-runners.

# Final results

```
VictoriapjðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²âŒš
